The code starts by declaring a variable NFTs using the const keyword and initializing it as an empty array. This variable will be used to store the NFT objects.

The mintNFT function is defined. It takes four parameters: _name, _eyeColor, _shirtType, and _bling. This function is responsible for creating an NFT object using the provided parameters as its metadata and storing it in the NFTs array.

Inside the mintNFT function, a new object named NFT is created using the provided parameters as properties. The object has four properties: name, eyeColor, shirtType, and bling, which correspond to the NFT's metadata.

The newly created NFT object is pushed into the NFTs array using the push method.

A message is logged to the console, indicating that an NFT has been minted. The _name parameter is concatenated with the message for display.

The listNFTs function is defined. It iterates through the NFTs array using a for loop and prints the metadata of each NFT object using console.log().

Inside the loop, the ID of each NFT is displayed by adding 1 to the index i. The name, eyeColor, shirtType, and bling properties of each NFT object are then printed using console.log()
